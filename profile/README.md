# What is LonaDB
LonaDB is a early prototype of a Database written in JavaScript. <br>
It uses JSON to store everything and supports different users.
<br>
<br>
# How does it work?
LonaDB is a Open Source Project and can be self-hosted. It uses the Node.JS Library "net" to start a socket. <br>
Requests can be sent from a Client. These requests are stringified JSONs containing all data required from the server to operate and give the requested variable's value for example. <br>
It sounds more dumb than it is
<br>
<br>
# Where can I install LonaDB?
This is how to install LonaDB:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonaDB/Server
cd Server

npm i
```
But please remember to change the 2 settings in the ``config.js`` file.

# What is LonaDB
LonaDB is a early prototype of a Database written in JavaScript. <br>
It uses AES-Encrypted JSONs to store data, supports different users and comes with a strong permission-system.
<br>
<br>
# How does it work?
The [LonaDB Server](https://github.com/LonaDB/Server) uses a TCP socket for communication with the clients. The requests sent by the clients are stringified JSONs, which are parsed. These contain all needed informations to answer and, for example, create a user.
<br>
<br>
# Is there a Web-Interface?
Yes! We have our own [Webinterface](https://github.com/LonaDB/Webinterface) <br>
It is a express.js server that utilizes express-handlebars to provide you with everything you need.
Currently, it is our youngest prototype and is not finished... Yet!
<br>
